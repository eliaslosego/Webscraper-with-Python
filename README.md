# Webscraper-with-Python
Automated web-browsing using Selenium chromedriver, parses HTML and outputs a .CSV file. Utilizes the Selenium webdriver through the Chrome browser to automate navigation
of www.OutsidePride.com and access live/dynamic data tables. Parses webpage HTML to scrape data related to product specifications and write relevant data to a .CSV file.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to scrape and sort data related to product specifications on the website listed above. The default product sorting and organization available on the
website is limited and restricts sorting parameters to only a few specifications. Scraping the pages for data that was relevant to the user and writing to a .CSV file allowed
greater sorting and organization capabilities. The user is able to search and sort products available through the site by a greater range of specifications than was previously 
available.
